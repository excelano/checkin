/// Single owner of `AVAudioSession` category transitions. Before this lived
/// here, `SpeechService` set `.playAndRecord` on listening and `TTSService`
/// set `.soloAmbient` on speaking, with each side ignorant of the other.
/// Two paths could fight: a tap-mic during TTS swapped category while the
/// synth was mid-utterance, which wedges `AVSpeechSynthesizer` for the rest
/// of the session (Apple's documented gotcha).
///
/// Now the coordinator drives transitions through this controller, calls
/// `configure(for:)` once per phase change, and the per-utterance synth
/// recreation in `AppleTTSService` neutralizes the mid-utterance swap in any
/// path that still slips through.
///
/// Earcons play through `play(_:)` so they fire under whichever category is
/// active for the current phase. That respects silent during speaking
/// (`.soloAmbient`) and bypasses it during listening/disambiguating
/// (`.playAndRecord` — recording-capable categories all bypass by iOS design).
